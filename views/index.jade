        p.
          <a href="http://www.campfirenow.com" class="emph">Campfire</a> (by 37Signals) is a wonderful group chat application.
          I wanted to bring it to my current company,
          but found it a hard sell because it is easy to miss real time information if youâ€™re not
          sitting in the campfire rooms all the time. There's no sure fire way to get someone attention.
          So one weekend back in 2011 I sat down to come up with a solution. My employer didn't have Hack Days so I did
          one on my own.

        p.
          <a href="http://www.smokesignalnow.com" class="emph">Smoke Signal</a> provides a way to get the attention of other members of the campfire.
          Hence the name <i>Smoke Signal</i>.
          If the person sees your message and responds, all is good. But if they don't respond in a timely fashion
          they are sent an email or SMS. To initiate a smoke signal just use a &#8220;@<i>Name</i>&#8221; tag anywhere in a campfire post.
          Smoke Signal does the rest. Read on to learn more.

        p<b>1. Sending a Smoke Signal</b>
        p.pspacerabove The screen snippet below shows an example of a smoke signal I sent my son in our family campfire.
        image(src="images/Callout2.png")
        p For &#8220;#{sampleName}&#8221; any of these work:
        ul
          // loop over all the called out options
          each form in calloutForms
            li @#{form}
        <br/>
        p Requirements: it uniquely identifies a member of your campfire and is >=3 characters in length.

        p<b>2. Triggering an Email</b>
        p.pspacerabove.
          If the called out person enters the campfire room and/or posts a message in a timely fashion then
          the smoke signal is finished. If after a couple minutes there is no response, the smoke signal email is triggered:
        :markdown
          > To: jake@email.com

          > Subject: Smoke Signal - room XYZ,

          >           from Peter

          > Body:

          > https:_url-to-the-campfire-room_

          > @Jake - where's soccer on friday?
          </br></br>
          > Sincerely,
          </br>

        p<b>3. Configuration</b>
        p.pspacerabove.
          The target email address and delay are both configurable directly through campfire.
          Take a look:
        image(src="images/SSConfig.png")
        p.
          The first 2 messages will email you the requested information.
          The next sets the number of <em>minutes</em> before Smoke Signals
          are emailed to <em>you</em>. And the last changes your email address.

          Smoke Signal automatically emails a tutorial to all new members.
